Q1: The patch improve the performance of ls since
POSIX.1-2008 came out and specified that -a and -A
should override each other, so it is more stardardized.

Q2: The company should watch out if there are features
that are already built dependent on the buggy feature of
unmodified ls. If so, after the patch version is adopted
, there may be new bugs on these features.

Q3: IndexError occurs: index out of range. This is because this
is an empty file so random.choice() fails.

Q4: In python3, the following syntax
        except IOError as (errno, strerror):
    fails, since in python3 this feature is not supported, have to say
    	except IOError as err:
    then refer errno as err.errno, strerror as err.strerror instead.
