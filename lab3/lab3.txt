Laboratory: Installing a small change to a big package

1. The output of the command `gpg --verify
--keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig` is:

gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
gpg: Good signature from "Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9

which means that the verification is successful


2. I did the following steps:
Untar the compressed file using command `tar -xvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz`
cd into the resulting folder, and run configure with the prefix option be
my own directory, and then make install

3. I cd into my directory, then into bin, and test with `./ls -aA`, which
shows the buggy result

4. I copy the patch file into the folder coreutils-8.29 and run
`patch -p1 < patch.diff`, which shows that the NEWS file is not
successfully patched while the other 3 files are successfully patched

5. In order to make successfully, I edit the patch file so that it
only patches the ls.c file. And I redo the step 2, patch the edited
patch to the source code and run the make command
the command I used here are: patch -p1 < patch.diff ; make

6. As tested, the modified ls works within the src directory
inside the package while the unmodified that was installed on my
own directory does not work
