Lab partner: Kelly Cheng

1. I have Ubuntu 18.04 pre-installed on my computer in which I perform the
lab. After setting up and connecting beaglebone to Ubuntu, I ssh into it by:
root@beaglebone:~# ssh root@192.168.7.2
My partner and I both connect the devices to my personal hotspot of my phone

2. Then, I update the software and install Openssh:
root@beaglebone:~# sudo apt-get update
root@beaglebone:~# sudo apt-get install openssh-server
root@beaglebone:~# sudo apt-get install openssh-client

3. I setup the configuration for server side:
setting up client account:
root@beaglebone:~# sudo useradd -d /home/client -m client
root@beaglebone:~# sudo passwd client
root@beaglebone:~# cd /home/client
root@beaglebone:~# sudo mkdir .ssh
root@beaglebone:~# sudo chown -R client .ssh
root@beaglebone:~# sudo chmod 700 .ssh

I run `ifconfig` and get the IP address of mine: 172.20.10.8
while my parter's IP address is 172.20.10.7

Then I wait for my partner to be client, and it works fine.

4. I setup the configuration for client side:
generate keys:

root@beaglebone:~# ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Created directory '/root/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
bd:dd:7a:83:9f:5c:ab:db:bd:fa:11:36:6e:e4:2b:5d root@beaglebone
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+

|            .*XBo|

The public key I used is: breadracer

Then I login to my partner's server: (The username is also client)
root@beaglebone:~# ssh client@172.20.10.7
I enter the password, and then logout.

Then, to setup key-based authentication, I do:
root@beaglebone:~# ssh-copy-id -i client@172.20.10.7
After typing yes, I type in my password to login, and then exit.
Then, I do:
root@beaglebone:~# eval "$(ssh-agent)"
root@beaglebone:~# ssh-add
The public key I entered is: breadracer
And afterwards I can login without typing anything.

Then I try:
root@beaglebone:~# ssh -X client@172.20.10.7
$ xterm
$ gedit
$ firefox
Initially, xterm and gedit doesn't work, and after my partner doing:
$ sudo apt-get install xterm
$ sudo apt-get install gedit
the three commands all work.
ssh -X and ssh -Y, according to the source in the assignment page,
differ in that ssh -X is more secure than ssh -Y. ssh -X treats the
remote machine as an untrusted client while -Y treats as trusted.
I guess that ssh -X will intercept and reject some sensitive request
made by the client while ssh -Y will not.
